# digitalcreationism

### About Me
I'm a Japanese designer living Tokyo. I have been designing web apps, mobile apps, and some graphic design stuff. 
I have very little experience with GitHub and programming, so I may need your help organizing the project here!

### About the project
This is a project started on Oct 20, 2017. 
Nothing serious, I thought it would be fun to write the whole new Bible in digital context.
Digital Creationism respects, appreciates and celebrates all religions :)

---

### Basic Rules
- Anyone can commit and send push
- Anyone can update the contents
- BUT do not include followings: racism, sexism, violence, or political contents

---

### How can you contribute?
- By writing new verses or chapters in the language(s) that you prefer
- By translating other languages into your language 
- BUT do not Google Translate into/from languages you do not know.

Note:
Any language is welcomed, and contents in all the language don't have to be the same. I'm open to having different contents in different languages(like so in Wikipedia)🙂
