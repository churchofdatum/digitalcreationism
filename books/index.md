## About This Project
This is a project started on Oct 20, 2017. Nothing serious, I thought it would be fun to write the whole new Bible in digital context. There is no intention of offending enyone. Digital Creationism respects, appreciates and celebrates all religions :) Looking for peeps who can help me build Digital Creationism on GitHub. If you have ideas for any verses or chapters, feel free to send me a pull request.

Praise be to you and your gigabytes 🙌🏻
