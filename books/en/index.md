# And God said, _"Hello World!"_
:::

# Genesis

## The Biginning
In the beginning God created the visible and invisible. Now the visible was formless and empty, invisible was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the editor.

And God said, “Hello World!,” and there was an output. God saw that the output was good, and he separated the visible from the invisible. God called the output “client,” and the invisible he called “server.” And there was frontend, and there was backend—the first page.

## The Network of Eden
Because Nobody Believes in Magic Apples Any More (After Gen. 2 and 3)
Now the System Administrator had created a network in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. The System Administrator made all kinds of software available on the network — software that could answer any question, solve any problem, perform any task, and that controlled machines that could make anything at all, and allow the man a life of perfect ease and comfort. In the middle of the software directory was the program ForbiddenFruit.

The System Administrator took the man and put him in charge of the Network of Eden to work it and take care of it. And the System Administrator commanded the man, “You are free to run any software on the network; but you must not run the program ForbiddenFruit, for when you do your network privileges will certainly be revoked.”

Now the Hacker was more crafty than any of the other users the System Administrator had allowed on the Network. He said to the woman, “Did the System Administrator really say, ‘You must not run any software on the Network?”

The woman said to the Hacker, “We may run any software on the Network, but the System Administrator did say, ‘You must not run the program ForbiddenFruit, for when you do, your network privileges will certainly be revoked.’”

“Your network privileges will not be revoked,” the Hacker said to the woman. “For the System Administrator has crippled your software. He knows that when you run the program ForbiddenFruit, your powers will be unlimited, and you will be like The System Administrator, able to do anything at all.”

The woman saw that the program ForbiddenFruit allowed her to do things she had never imagined. She also showed her husband, who was with her, and he used it to do still more things. But it also deleted essential files that enabled them to access the Network. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they had corrupted their computers; so they closed out the program ForbiddenFruit and pretended to log onto Facebook.

Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the System Administrator as he entered the chat room in the cool of the day, and they hid from the System Administrator by playing Solitaire. But the System Administrator texted the man, “Where are you?”
He answered, “I heard you in the chat room, and I was afraid because my files were corrupted; so I hid.”

And the System Administrator said, “Who told you that your files were corrupted? Have you used the program that I commanded you not to run?” The man said, “The woman you put here with me — she ran the program to do a few things, and they seemed harmless, so I did more.” Then the System Administrator said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” The woman said, “The Hacker deceived me, and I ran ForbiddenFruit.”
So the System Administrator said to the Hacker, “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all users! You will crawl on your belly and you will send nothing but spam all the days of your life. And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crash your servers and break up your botnets, and you will not be able to stop him.”

To Adam he said, “Because you listened to your wife and ran the program about which I commanded you, ‘You must not run it,’ cursed is the Network because of you; through painful toil you will struggle to use it all the days of your life. It will produce bugs and crashes for you. You will be plagued by slow connections, viruses and malware. By the sweat of your brow you will struggle to run even simple programs, and all the powers you once had access to will be unavailable any more.”

The System Administrator said, “The man has now become like one of us, and knows what the Network is fully capable of. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and restore his connection.” So the System Administrator banished him from the Network of Eden to be content with slow connections and crufty software. After he drove the man out, he ran FlamingSword and disconnected the man from the Network so there was nothing at all the man could do to restore the connection.

## Noah and Y2K
This is the account of Noah and his websites.
Noah was a righteous man, a full stack, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God. Noah could build anything he could have imagined.

Now the web was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence.  God saw how corrupt the web had become, for all the people on web had corrupted their ways. So God said to Noah, “I am going to put an end to all people, for the web is filled with two-digit field for years because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the web.

## About This Project
This is a project started on Oct 20, 2017. Nothing serious, I thought it would be fun to write the whole new Bible in digital context. There is no intention of offending enyone. Digital Creationism respects, appreciates and celebrates all religions `:)` Looking for peeps who can help me build Digital Creationism on GitHub. If you have ideas for any verses or chapters, feel free to send me a pull request.
